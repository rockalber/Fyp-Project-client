                    Protecting your information is a  top priority for this site. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt your  credit card number, name and address, so only this site is able to decode  your information.
                    SSL is the industry standard method for computers to  communicate securely without risk of data interception, manipulation or  recipient impersonation. To be sure your connection is secure; when you are in
                    the Shopping Cart, look at the lower corner of your browser window. If you see  an unbroken key or closed lock, the SSL is active and your information is  secure. Since most of the customers are still uncomfortable with providing your
           credit card online, we use PayPal and 2CheckOut services and they do not need to  give out credit card information.</p>
